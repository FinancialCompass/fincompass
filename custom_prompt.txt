Please analyze this receipt image and generate:
1. A brief, unique description of the purchase/transaction (1 sentence that captures the key aspects like merchant type, main items, or purpose)
2. Structured data in the following JSON format:

{
  "summary": string, // A unique, specific description (e.g., "Grocery run for fresh produce at Sprouts" or "Dessert order of three items from Main Street Restaurant")
  "metadata": {
    "merchant_name": string,
    "merchant_address": {
      "street": string,
      "city": string,
      "state": string,
      "zip": string
    },
    "merchant_phone": string,
    "date": string (YYYY-MM-DD format),
    "time": string (HH:MM format),
    "receipt_id": string
  },
  "transaction": {
    "subtotal": number,
    "tax": number,
    "tip": number,
    "total": number,
    "payment_method": {
      "type": string,
      "entry_method": string,
      "card_type": string (if applicable)
    }
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "quantity": number,
      "unit_price": number,
      "total_price": number,
      "category": string (e.g., "PRODUCE", "DESSERT")
    }
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. For the summary, focus on:
   - Type of establishment
   - Main purpose of purchase
   - Notable items or quantities
   - Unique aspects of the transaction
2. Preserve original capitalization for item names
3. Convert all prices to numbers (remove currency symbols)
4. If tax is not explicitly stated, set it to null
5. For quantities, extract from item description if available
6. Categorize items based on their nature
7. Format dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
8. Include all available merchant identification numbers in metadata
9. If any field is not present in the receipt, set it to null rather than omitting it
